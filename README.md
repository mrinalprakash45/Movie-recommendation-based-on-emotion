Recommending Movies based on a person's emotion

## Getting Started
There are 8 classes of emotion that would be effective to classify a text. These are: ‘Anger’, ‘Anticipation’, ‘Disgust’, ‘Fear’, ‘Joy’, ‘Sad’, ‘Surprise’, ‘Trust’. Here these are taken as input and the corresponding movies would be displayed for the emotion.
The correspondence of every emotion with genre of movies is listed below:

* Sad – Drama
* Disgust – Musical
* Anger – Family
* Anticipation – Thriller
* Fear – Sport
* Enjoyment – Thriller
* Trust – Western
* Surprise – Film-Noir

Based on the input emotion, the corresponding genre would be selected and all the top 5 movies of that genre would be recommended to the user using web scraping.
